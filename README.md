The quiz management application utilizes CRUD operations and employs microservices architecture, with each module developed independently and connected through an API gateway. Built on Spring Boot framework, this setup offers a hands-on experience in microservices development. Each module, including user management, quiz creation, question bank, and result tracking, is encapsulated as a microservice, facilitating scalability and modularity. The API gateway orchestrates communication between these microservices, providing a unified interface for clients. This architecture enhances flexibility, allowing for easy updates and modifications to individual modules without affecting the entire system. Additionally, the use of Spring Boot ensures rapid development and deployment, streamlining the process of building and managing the quiz management application.
